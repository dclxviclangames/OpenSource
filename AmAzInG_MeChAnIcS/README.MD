# Interesting Interaction Mechanics: Physical World, Environments & Procedural Animations

A curated collection of research, prototypes, and implementations focusing on immersive interaction design, dynamic environment manipulation, and logic-driven procedural animations.

## 🚀 Overview
This repository explores the boundaries between user input and digital reality. Instead of relying on pre-baked animations, we focus on real-time calculations that make the virtual world feel "alive" and reactive.

## 🧪 Core Concepts

### 1. Physical World Interactions
*   **Weight & Friction Simulation:** Objects that don't just move, but carry momentum and resistance based on their material properties.
*   **Tactile Feedback:** Systems designed to simulate the sense of touch through visual and auditory cues.
*   **Constraint-Based Physics:** Using joints, springs, and ropes to create complex mechanical puzzles.

### 2. Dynamic Environments (World Changes)
*   **Destructible Geometry:** Real-time mesh slicing and fracturing based on impact force.
*   **Adaptive Weather Systems:** Environments that change their physical properties (e.g., slippery surfaces during rain, snow accumulation).
*   **Persistent Traces:** World-state changes that remain, such as footprints, burn marks, or deformed terrain.

### 3. Procedural Animations
*   **IK (Inverse Kinematics) Rigging:** Characters that adapt their footing to uneven terrain in real-time.
*   **Verlet Integration:** Physics-based movement for hair, cloth, and soft bodies without traditional bones.
*   **Behavioral Motion:** Using math (Sine waves, Perlin noise) to create organic movement patterns for creatures and UI elements.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Engines:** Unity / Unreal Engine / Godot
*   **Physics:** PhysX, Havok, or custom-built solvers.
*   **Mathematics:** Linear Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calculus for motion logic.

## 📁 Repository Structure
*   `/Prototypes`: Small, isolated interaction experiments.
*   `/Shaders`: Visual effects that complement physical changes.
*   `/Scripts`: Reusable logic for procedural motion and world manipulation.
